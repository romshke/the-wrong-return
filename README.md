### The Wrong (re)Turn

It was a perfectly miserable autumn day: rain, gray skies, and your boss’s reluctant blessing to “enjoy” two whole vacation days. Not enough for the beach, but enough to visit your old uncle. He lives in the middle of nowhere and you've been too busy to even make a birthday call.

You packed light: clothes, essentials, and your old laptop — because nothing says rest like checking emails in the woods. The car was supposed to get you there by midnight.

Then came the wrong turns. The dead GPS. And finally — that sound.

A pop. A hiss. Your tire had quit. Congratulations.

You sighed, stepped into the rain, and stared at the dead tire. The forest offered no advice. The phone had one bar at first. Then none.

So you walked. Mud, fog, regret. At last, a gate appeared. Behind it, a mansion hunched in the dark, like an artefact of an era long gone, its windows faintly glowing. Maybe you could ask for a phone call, tell your uncle what happened, surely he could pick you up.

The only problem is the gate. How do you open it? There is a panel with 10 digits and a brief instruction:

The code to the gates is four digits. It is the first, the second, the third and the fourth most common digit in today's sequence, in that particular order. If there are equal number of appearances, higher digit should come first.

The sequence looks enormous, you could spend hours calculating the code by hand. Good thing you brought your laptop, right? A small program that calculates the answer should not be too hard...
